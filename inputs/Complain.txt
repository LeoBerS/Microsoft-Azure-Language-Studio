This agency is a fraud - they redirect you to a free city tour. We arrived to the meeting point and a guide wasn't there. We called the agency, and they told us to go to a different meeting point. Eventually we got to a group that was led by some college student volunteer, working for tips and who had nothing to do with this agency. This guide was genuinely surprised and said there are no reservations for his tour. I wish the previous review was available at the time of my booking. Avoid at all costs - they just collect your money for nothing.
